Just a quick reminder: the expectation is that your next essay will be supported by books and articles from Library subscription databases.

**Finding Books**

Online catalogs such as [CUNY+](http://apps.appl.cuny.edu:83/F?func=find-b-0) make it easy to find what you're looking for in a library's collection, including books, films, music and periodicals. CUNY+ offers a variety of search options to assist you in sifting through the variety of materials availabe to find the exact item you are looking for. The following is designed to help guide you through these search options.

Typically you can find the link for the library catalog by visiting the web page for the library.

Notice that a few bits of information are hyperlinked; these are links to more information or other lists of works related to the information already listed. We will highlight a few of them here.

**Author:** The name of the author, as it appears in this blue link, will produce a list of all of his works held by the Library.

**Title:** The title of the work, as it appears in this link, will bring up all of the titles held by the Library that match the title of your entry. You can find out if the Library owns different volumes of your work or the same work in another medium, such as a computer file or microfiche.

**Subject:** The subject links will search CUNY+ for all other works that fall under the same subject heading. These catalogers assigned these terms by drawing from an extensive and authoritative list of subject headings developed by the Library of Congress. For an in-depth description of subject headings, visit the [Library of Congress](http://cnx.org/content/m12585/latest/#loc) section of this guide. For now, just note that the linked subjects will take you to a list of all of the works that the Library has catagorized under the same subject headings as the work listed in the entry.

**Finding Articles**

Many online research sources, such as indexes, databases, and journals, are available only through subscription. Each year libraries pay significant fees to bring these resources to their patrons. To use fee-based online resources, users must be validated as belonging to an institution that has purchased a license. Vendors often restrict access to resources by IP (Internet Protocol) address, the address for your institution's network. If your institution has paid for a subscription to an electronic journal, database, or index, there are several ways that you can potentially access it. You can:

* Use the electronic resource at the library.
* Gain access from an office, dorm room, or other room on campus, provided that you are connected to the campus network. You can use either a wireless or a hard wired connection.
* Access the resource from off campus via a proxy server

Many people prefer to do their research from home rather than having to go into the library. Most universities provide a way for students, faculty and staff to access resources from off-campus. You can see our list of databases here: <http://libraries.cuny.edu/resource.htm>. You'll authenticate using your CUNY barcode.
