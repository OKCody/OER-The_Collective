# Using Open Education Resources in Your Class

using OER materials in a class is remarkably similar to using any materials. The difference, and challenge, lies in the format limitations. Not everything is available everywhere, so faculty might spend some time trying to track down the material they need in the format in which it is needed. For instance, a biology professor might want some OER materials on cell division. The professor might find some OER readings, but no activities, in a particular collection. The professor could either search other collections, as outlined in Module 3, the professor could adapt a comparable assignment on a similar topic, or the professor could create the missing content herself.

Because OER encompasses so many types of materials, faculty might find it helpful as a source of inspiration. The syllabus of a similar class might provide new insights into how to approach a topic. Someone else's assignment could open the gates to a completely new way to assess student learning.

The following two case studies show how OER material can be combined to create a new resource.
